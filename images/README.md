# Reference Screenshots

This directory contains reference screenshots from E2E tests.

## main-view.png

The main view of the Location Tracker app on first launch.

This screenshot is automatically updated by CI after E2E tests:
- E2E tests capture the main view screenshot
- Screenshot is normalized (metadata stripped with optipng)
- A PR is automatically created with the updated screenshot
- Review the visual appearance and merge if correct

**Note:** Minor differences like timestamps are expected between runs. Screenshots are normalized to remove EXIF/metadata before storage.

This serves as both documentation and visual reference for the app's UI.
